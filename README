# Ising PID Experiments

This repository contains the code used to generate the numerical results
in the paper

> **Multivariate Partial Information Decomposition:  
> Constructions, Inconsistencies, and Alternative Measures**  
> A. Lyu, A. Clark, and N. Raviv

The code reproduces all Partial Information Decomposition (PID) results
reported for the Ising model in the manuscript.

## Contents

- `experiment1_local_pid.py`  
  Implements **Experiment 1**, which analyzes the informational
  contributions of neighboring spins to the instantaneous state of a
  central lattice site.

- `experiment2_emergent_order.py`  
  Implements **Experiment 2**, which treats coarse-grained local spatial
  order as the target variable and investigates the emergence of
  synergistic information near criticality.

## Requirements

The code was tested with Python 3.10 and requires the following packages:

- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- tqdm

All dependencies can be installed via:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
